# Vic2.-TGC-EGF
The Grand Combination mod for Victoria 2, with the Extra German Flavour Mod created by me.
Install Instructions:

1. Unzip File
2. Drag and drop the contents of "German Extra Flavour" into your Mod directory
3. Enable the mod WITH TCG!
4. Enjoy :D

IMPORTANT!!!
Version 4.1 of my mod is compatible with the latest Master build of TCG mod, only (Version 0.1.5)

Some parts of this mod have been integrated into TGC -like extra province renamer and some others, including bug fixes- though if you want to use all the things they left out, you need to use this mod.
